            "answer": "1. Download the [KTANE Modkit](https://github.com/Qkrisi/ktanemodkit) [visual demo of both options]\n* Assuming you have a github account (see {command-github} for more details), you can create your own repository using the modkit. Press `Use this template` -> `Create new repository`. Add a name and press `Create repository`. Clone your project to your device.\n* If you don't have a github account, you can get the project, by pressing `Code` -> `Download zip`. Extract the project. It is recommended that you change the name of the folder to be whatever the name of your mod is: \"The Simpleton\" for example.\n1. Download [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) (optional)\nUnity Hub is a tool that allows you to see all of your Unity projects in one place. It's optional, but highly recommended if you plan to make multiple Unity projects. You can add a Unity project by selecting `Open` and selecting the folder of your project. It should be the one that contains `Assets` inside of it.\n2. Install a IDE\nAn IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a tool that makes writing code **much** easier. It allows you to see what is wrong with your code without needing to constantly check Unity. It also color codes your words and has autocompletion which will make writing code quicker. Although you can write scripts by just using Notepad, it is not recommended.\nThe two most common IDEs are Visual Studio (VS) and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) [installation to both](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Both require some setup to get working with Unity. Here are the steps to do so:\n* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity)\n* [VS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/gamedev/unity/get-started/getting-started-with-visual-studio-tools-for-unity?pivots=windows)\nIgnore the steps about installing packages as that is not supported in the Unity version for KTANE.\n1. Add a plugin template (Optional) [visual demo]\nThere are several pre-made templates that streamline the process of creating mods. Although optional, they are very useful for beginners. They can be found by pressing `KeepTalking ModKit` -> `Plugins` at the top of the Unity editor. Which one you use is up to personal preference.\nThese are the steps to set up your project for modding.

You will learn new things as you continue using the tools. If you need to ask a question on how to do something, try googling it to see if someone else has asked the question before.

It’s okay if you don’t get it right away as everyone learns at their own pace, but there isn’t a shortcut.\nIf you feel intimidated by the learning process, start small and grow from there. Try making a basic mod; recreate The Simpleton for example, and use what you learned in order to make your “dream” module.

            "answer": "GitHub is a website that holds your code. Think of it like Google Drive. Although GitHub is not required, it is definitely recommended as it allows you to work on your project on different devices and lets other people see and collaborate with your work. Here are the steps to set up git/Github.\n\n1. Create a GitHub account\n2. Install git. Follow this tutorial for installing it on [windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HhEupU4iGU). Other OS tutorials can be found easily\n3. Figure out which application you want to use in order to use git. There are several applications that have git controls inside of them. For basic purposes, you will need to know how to:\n* create a new **repository** (project on github)\n* **clone** (download a project that is on Github)\n* **commit** (save your changes)\n* **push** (“upload” your commits/changes)\n* **pull** (“download” your commits/changes)\n\nHere are some tutorials explaining some of the git terminology including how to publish an existing Unity project to Github. Before you are about to publish your code to GitHub, verify you have a .gitignore file that looks something like [this](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore) in your root directory (should be on the same level of your “Assets” folder). This forbids unwanted bloated files being sent to GitHub. If it is not there, download it and replace it in the correct folder.\n* [Visual Studio Code](https://youtu.be/i_23KUAEtUM)\n* [Github Desktop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn1YgU81GUY)\n* [Command line](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)",

Rename the folder `Template Manual` to the name of your mod.\n2. **Write the manual**: Inside the `HTML` you will find a `HTML` file called `Module Name`. Rename that to your module name. Open that file in a text editor, (Visual Studio is preferred, but not required). This is where you write your manual with HTML.\n    * It's recommended to read `Tutorial (delete when done).html` in your browser as it will show you how to use some HTML.\n\n    * More tutorials\n        * [HTML](https://youtu.be/HD13eq_Pmp8)\n        * [CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRNinF7YQqQ)\n        * [Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihy0QziLDf0&list=PLZPZq0r_RZOO1zkgO4bIdfuLpizCeHYKv) (will rarely be used for basic manuals)\n    * [Video demonstration](https://youtu.be/YobuGSBl3i0?t=10097)\n3. **Verify your pages don't exceed the page boundaries.** This can be done by pressing Alt + P in the browser to enable developer mode.

A template of the svg can be found in the `HTML\\img\\Component`\nfolder. Rename `Module Name.svg` to the name of the mod. Be sure to change the appropriate HTML in your manual to have this name change as well. Otherwise it will not show up in the manual.\n    * [Inkscape tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzk-suGcqrc&ab_channel=LogosByNick)\n5. **Make the JSON**.\n    1. Go to the [Repository of Manual Pages](https://ktane.timwi.de) -> `Tools` -> `Create new module`. Fill out the information and press `Generate JSON`\n        * Please verify that no other mod shares any of the following information\n            * Name\n            * Module ID\n            * Sort key\n            * Steam ID\n    2. Copy the information to your clipboard\n    3. In the manual template, open the `JSON` folder. Open `Module Name.json` in your text editor and paste the content you copied\n    4. Rename `Module Name.json` to your actual module name.\n    * [Video demonstration](https://youtu.be/YobuGSBl3i0?t=11850)\n1. **Lint your manual**: Zip the entire manual folder (what was originally called `Template Manual`), and send it to <@{logBotId}> with the message `!lint` via a dm. The bot will check if\nthere is anything wrong with your manual (including any images and the JSON). If you see any warnings, fix them, and lint the new version of the manual.

            "answer": "The [wiki](https://github.com/Qkrisi/ktanemodkit/wiki/KMSelectable) states the return value of the delegate specifies “ whether it should drill into children”. If you think of the module as a [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(abstract_data_type)#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20tree,a%20set%20of%20connected%20nodes.), with the module being the root node, you can move to and from other children. A good example of this is the mod [Quadruple Simpleton Squared](https://github.com/KTANE-MODS/Quadruple-Simpleton-Squared). The root node is the mod itself, but if we select the top left quadrant of the mod, that will be the current node since the delegate returns true. If we select the top left button, the interaction will occur but the current node will still be the top left quadrant since the delegate of the button returns false. When we right click, the current node becomes the current node’s parent. In this case, the current node would be the module again.\nIf you do not want any sections of your mod, all your buttons work as standard buttons, then you should have all of your KMSelectable OnInteract delegates return false and have no children.
